# Mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where you, the player, tries to guess a secret four-digit code generated by the computer. At the end of each guess, the computer will provide feedback on the the player's guess in the following forms.

The computer will tell the player if:
  1. a correct digit was guessed in the correct spot
  1. a correct digit was guessed but in the wrong spot
  1. an incorrect digit was guessed

**The feedback will *not* reveal which number the player guessed correctly!**

The Player must guess the right number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game.

Core:
- ✅ Ability to guess the combinations of 4 numbers
- ✅ Ability to view the history of guesses and their feedback
- ✅ The number of guesses remaining is displayed
- ✅ Uses [Random generator API](https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/) to randomly select 4 numbers from 0 ~ 7 (Duplicate numbers are allowed)

Extra:
- Mobile first design
- on-screen "keyboard" limited to Secret Code's possible characters provides straightforward  UI that doesn't need explanation
- Results Modal to which reveals the Secret Code and number of Turns taken by player
- Clicking the title, Mastermind, or the question mark besides it brings up the Rules modal at any time, allowing the Player to restart the game.
- Tab-enabled keyboard navigation for keyboard play


# Process

## Storybook
Storybook is a tool I used for building the UI components in isolation. I like how it allows me to focus on the individual component and its interface. In the component library you can view the components, their variants, and even change their props and see the changes live.

To start storybook:
```
npm run storybook
```

## Tests
I used Jest & Testing-Library to do my unit testing.

To run tests:
```
npm run test
```

# Wishlist

1. hide keyboard when not `isPlaying`
1. capture keyboard input
1. feature: option to make game easier by only allowing unique numbers in the secret code (no duplicates)
1. automatically focus on the current guess
